2.	Secured and monitored web infrastructure.

In this logic we are still using 2 tiers logic, but we have added firewall, SSL to secure our data on web and monitoring app to monitor our web application.
We are adding firewall to add a security layer for our web application adding a SSL for another security layer for our website communication secure service and a monitoring service to monitor the performance of our web application.

WHAT IS FIREWALL: firewalls are software, or it could be a hardware to control the traffic in our infrastructure according to the set rules.

TRAFFIC ARE SERVER OVER HTPPS: to secure traffic over the http request and response we must secure it using SSL certificate.
Monitoring is used to collect performance metrics, log data, and monitor system health.

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue because at that level we dropped the security now the data is vulnerable.

Having a SQL database with written might be an issue if it goes down, without a back-up all the data will be lost, and this is a critical issue for the client and the server.

Having a server with all the components is a big issue also as if it fails all the components on it will be lost, the solution is to have a recovery site so that when we meet a failure issue we will have a failsafe option.
