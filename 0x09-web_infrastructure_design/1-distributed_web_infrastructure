1.	Distributed web infrastructure:

With addition to the design, we had before, we decided to add a second server, the logic we had was 2 tier, now we are going to adopt a 3 tier logic.

In this logic we have separated the storage (DATA BASE), now it has its own server hosting.

The other server hosts webserver, web application, application files and a load balancer.

So, on the database we still use the same type as the first used in the previous design.
The only thing here we must check, is how we are connecting to the database, here we will choose to connect using socket type.

1. Load Balancer (HAProxy):

Distributes incoming traffic across web servers.
Distribution Algorithm: Round Robin.
We are using active-active, active-active means we are deploying more than one instance to work hand in hand at the same time, while active-passive one instance works (active) and the other on stand by to work once active is down(passive).

SPOF, the single point of failure on this model, adding to the first design, every traffic is passing through a load balancer, if it failure it will disrupt the service

FIREWALL, HTTPS: to ensure that we are secure on server side and web side, we have to set a firewall in this case we have not set it yet, and on web side we have to use an SSL/TLS to secure our webpage so that the data transmitted there is secure and private.
